# Enshrouded Community Hosting Resources
This repository serves as a guide for anyone looking to host their own Enshrouded server. It may link to other projects, repos, guides, etc.

If you'd like to rent a server from a provider, [we are also maintaining a list of those here.](https://github.com/PR3SIDENT/enshrouded-server/blob/main/Hosting%20Providers/hosting-providers.md)

# SteamCMD
The SteamCMD tool is a complex tool that is provided by Steam for the purpose of installing game servers through more scripted methods.  There are both windows and linux versions of the SteamCMD tool, and it is beyond the scope of this FAQ to provide assistance on all of the features of this command.

That said, when executed, it will download all of the game files to the folder specified:

In general, the command works like this:

`steamcmd +force_install_dir <PATH TO INSTALL FOLDER> +login anonymous +app_update 2278520 validate +quit`

This will install the game server. From there, you might need to install VC2022 Redistributable (depending on your environment).

Last but not least Configure the Server Configuration File following the guide.

To start the server, simply run `enshrouded_server.exe`  or if running on Linux `wine64 ./enshrouded_server.exe` There are no command line arguments.

Dedicated Server Running Verification
The Server is running when you see ```HostOnline (Up!)``` message.
