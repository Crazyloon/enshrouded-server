# Pterodactye Egg Experience

The Egg found here is an experimental egg. It was what was used for Closed Beta testing, but is not perfect. 

As a more formal docker container is built, we may be able to point this egg to that docker to configure it to run.

It will need updates in order to run Early Access, so this is just for safe keeping.

# Couple of Notes

* What we know is that Enshrouded will be a Windows game. Unknown if there will be a Linux distribution for Linux servers.
* Use of Wine64 seemed to work - OK.
